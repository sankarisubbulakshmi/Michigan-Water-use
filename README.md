# Michigan Water Use Dataset (2013 - 2022)
## Overview
The Michigan Water Use dataset provides detailed information about water usage in various counties across Michigan from 2013 to 2022. 
It includes data on the volume of water drawn from different sources such as the Great Lakes, groundwater, and inland surface water. 
This dataset is useful for environmental research, resource management, and policy-making related to water usage.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains multiple records, each representing the water usage statistics for a specific county and year. Here's a description of each column:

1. Number: A unique identifier for each record.
2. Industry: Categorical variable indicating the industry sector associated with the water usage data (e.g., Commercial-Institutional, Industrial-Manufacturing, Irrigation, etc.).
3. Year: Numerical variable representing the year in which the water usage data was recorded.
4. Great Lakes (Gallons): This column represents the amount of water withdrawn from the Great Lakes by the specific industry in a given year. Units are in gallons.
5. Groundwater (Gallons): This column represents the amount of water withdrawn from groundwater sources by the specific industry in a given year. Units are in gallons.
6. Inland Surface Water (Gallons): This column represents the amount of water withdrawn from inland surface water sources (e.g., rivers, streams) by the specific industry in a given year. Units are in gallons.
7. Total Gallons: This column represents the total water usage for each industry in a given year, calculated as the sum of water withdrawn from the Great Lakes, groundwater, and inland surface water sources.
   Units are in gallons.
8. county: The name of the county in Michigan.

## Learning Outcomes
From this dataset, we know this dataset is unsupervised learning, beacuse it doesn't have any clear target column. 
so we can only grouping the columns and find something useful so this unsupervised learning

## Dataset Source
This dataset was obtained from Kaggle.
